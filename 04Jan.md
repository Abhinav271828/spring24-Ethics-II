# Terminology
## Ethics and Morals
Morals are socially conveyed and enforced teachings, and vary for the same reason from culture to culture. Ethics, on the other hand, are a personal code of conduct internal to individuals.

An *ideology*, at the minimum, is the naturalisation of social relations. For instance, families (as understood in the modern sense) are collections of a small number of unrelated people, which we consider to be a "natural" unit.  
This is deeper and more fundamental than belief systems (capitalism, Marxism) or religions.

## Story, Plot and Narrative
A story is an overarching sequence of events, while the plot is the set of actions that allow these events to unfold. The narrative is the way the story is told.
