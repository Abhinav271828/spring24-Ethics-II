# Witnessing and Testifying
Testifying is broader than witnessing – it is vouching for the truth of one's own personal experiences or observations. Witnessing, on the other hand, is from a third-person perspective exclusively. The legal understanding of truth is founded on these two things.

*Ek Ruka Hua Faisla* constructs a character and a scene without ever showing it; we as viewers rely on unreliable witness accounts of the character and events. It drives home the point that justice's burden is not to produce or prove truth. It is to testify for the accused, not the crime, by producing a *narrative*.
