# Film Analysis
* Voice of God: A third-person, disembodied, omniscient narrator, who dictates viewers' perspective of the characters and the plot. One of the most common styles of documentary is voice-of-God narration, which *Night and Fog* follows; *Shoah* does not.

# Shoah
The camera always seems to be "looking for" the bodies; the shots following the descriptions of locations where bodies were dumped are of those very same locations, *e.g.*, cattle cars, the Narew river, the mass graves. This gives the impression of attempting to allow the viewer to empathize with the camp inhabitants, survivors and victims alike.  
The uncomfortable focus on the interviewee and the relentless questions create an impression of survivor's guilt.
