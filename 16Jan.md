# A History of the Documentary
When cameras were invented, there were three main uses of it – recording real life, expressing fantasies, and taking eyewitness records.  
As a tool for documentary, it was also used for colonial justification, to study the "natives" of colonized regions.

## Famine in Bengal
The 1943 Bengal famine was caused when Churchill diverted rice away from the Indian market to avoid it falling into Japanese hands. It follows a voice-of-God approach, and is clearly staged for the purpose of educating a very specific audience.

Most documentary films up to the 1980s followed this style.

# Shoah vs. Night and Fog
Shoah is much more personal and close-up than Night and Fog; the presence of the director, the testimony of the survivors, and the lack of archival footage all go to create an impression of the viewer actually being in the situation.  
Night and Fog, on the other hand, is impersonal – it uses voice-of-God narration and found footage, and documents *the plan of the oppressor*. It reconstructs the Nazi plan from the footage and documents left behind by the government.
