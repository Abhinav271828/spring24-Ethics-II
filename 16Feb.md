# New Customs (Ajay Nevaria) vs. Kafan (Munshi Premchand)
Many clues relating to the weather, style of speech and nomenclature tells us that the story is set somewhere in or around Rajasthan. The way the protagonist is addressed relates to his interpellation in society, which is a major theme of the story. Many clues, even before the question of addressing comes up, give us ideas of his identity – his determination to not appear "Bihari," and his concern for cleanliness, for instance.  
The story also points out the differing levels of confidence in people's claims to their happiness.  
Images like the dogs playing and the naked man are used to describe the caste situation.
